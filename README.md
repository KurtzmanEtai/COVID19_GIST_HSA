# COVID19_GIST_HSA

A free online solvation mapping of COVID19 related protein targets

For the protien apo sturcture, we currently have run GIST/HSA on 7 different targets (6JYT, 6LU7, 6M03, 6W4H, 6W63, 6Y84, 6YB7). For taget 6YB7, we have two different initial stucture, with M165 been fliped(flip) or keep original(no_flip)

For the protein-ligand complex, we currently have run GIST/HSA on 2 complexes ( 6W63_complex and 6Y84_complex).
