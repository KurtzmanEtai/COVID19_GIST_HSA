**This is a free online repository for sharing GIST/HSA data of COVID19 related protein targets**

For the protien apo sturcture, we currently have GIST/HSA data for 7 different targets (6JYT, 6LU7, 6M03, 6W4H, 6W63, 6Y84, 6YB7). For taget 6YB7, we have GIST/HSA data for two different initial stuctures,thus, with M165 fliped(flip) and with M165 be original(no_flip).

For the protein-ligand complex, we have GIST/HSA data for 2 complexes ( 6W63_complex and 6Y84_complex).

For the explanation of the file names under the target directory, please check the "File_list_explanation.csv" file.
